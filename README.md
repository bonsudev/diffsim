# DiffSim

## Introduction

DiffSim provides an atomistic approach to efficiently simulate Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) diffraction patterns by factorising and eliminating certain redundancies in the conventional approach. The method used is able to reduce the computation time by several orders of magnitude without compromising the recovered phase information and therefore enables feasible atomistic simulations on nanoscale crystals with arbitrary lattice distortions.
